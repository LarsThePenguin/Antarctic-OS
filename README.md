# Antarctic Operating System
This is a OS made from scratch. Intended to support Linux ELFs. </br>
At some point it might be able to support Windows EXEs and Windows APIs. </br>
(AKA Run Linux and Windows software) </br>
# Hardware Support
Its just x86-64 so far with Multiboot2 </br>
I don't know its based on CodePulse's OS kernel series </br>
Note: I don't know what type of BIOSes support Multiboot2, I am just using QEMU to run it currently </br>
